# Quick Start

## Requirements
In order to have forgae working you must have installed the following:
```
nodejs 
python 
docker 
```

Note: For older versions on windows you can use docker-toolbox
## Install

```text
npm install -g forgae
```

## Init a project

```text
forgae init
```

This will create `deployment` directory with `deploy.js` file inside. You can use this file to write your deployment procedure.

## Running local node
In a project folder:
```text
forgae node
```

To spwan a temporary local chain, use `forgae node --stop` to stop it.

## Access deployed smart contract functions

You can execute function of smart contract from deployed instance

Examples

```text
contract ExampleContract =

  public function say_hello(name : string) : string = 
    String.concat("Hello, ", name)

  public function donate() : int =
    Call.value
```

```javascript
let deployer = new Deployer('local', privateKey);
deployedContract = await deployer.deploy( contractPath, []); // empty array for init params

let result = await deployedContract.say_hello('World'); // result would be: "Hello, World"
```

or you can execute/call functions from another private/secret key

```javascript
const fromInstance = await deployedContract.from(anotherSecretKey);
let result = await fromInstance.say_hello('Friend'); // result would be: "Hello, Friend"
```

or you just want to donate some aettos

```javascript
await deployedContract.donate({ value: 991 });
```

## Deploying

Run the following in order to execute the deployment file created from the **forgae init** command:

```text
forgae deploy
```

## History of your deploys

In order to see a list of what you've deployed you can run the following command:

```text
forgae history
```
